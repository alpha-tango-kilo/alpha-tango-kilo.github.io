            Who is this Atk fella?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I'm a 20 year old computer science student.
            I enjoy any and all things computery - building computers, writing code, playing PC games, the whole shebang
        </p>
        <p>
            My most recent interest in the computing world has been Linux.
            I moved my personal laptop over to Arch Linux in late 2019 and have thoroughly enjoying working out everything as I go, building myself a competent customised workflow from the ground up.
            The FOSS community is awesome and I'm trying to find the time to give back to the community amoungst studying
        </p>
        <p>
            Privacy is also a huge part about the way I conduct myself online.
            Facebook, Google, Amazon, and the like possess a very real threat to everyone's privacy, seemingly without anyone caring.
            As such, I have been trying to migrate away from these data giants, ditching Gmail, Facebook, Twitch, and so on as I go, while also bolstering my personal security with a password manager and two factor authentication

            My monospace font of choice is <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono">Jetbrains Mono</a> for its readability and ligature support. (I am a <b>huge</b> ligature fan!)
        </p>
        <p>
            For serious coding, I love using the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com">Jetbrains IDEs</a>.
            I've mostly used IntelliJ and PyCharm, but I'd recommend the suite to anyone.
            Within the Jetbrains IDEs, I consider the <a href="https://www.material-theme.com">Material Theme plugin</a> essential to bring the UI into 2020.
            I use Material Darker of the themes it provides
        </p>
        <p>
            For casual projects (scripting languages or ones otherwise unsupported by Jetbrains), <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">Visual Studio Code</a> is my go-to
            If I'm feeling hardcore or just making quick changes, <a href="https://neovim.io">Neovim</a> does the trick nicely.
            I am by no means a Vim power user, but I can save & quit

            The best place to see more of my Linux lifestyle is over in my <a href="https://github.com/alpha-tango-kilo/dots">dotfiles repository</a>.
            In short, I currently use the <b>i3-gaps</b> window manager with <b>st</b> as my terminal of choice.
            I'm working on further patching <b>st</b>, so keep an eye on <a href="https://github.com/alpha-tango-kilo/st">my Github repo</a> for that.
            I'm also currently hacking <b><a href="http://www.qtile.org">Qtile</a></b> into shape to potentially move to that

            Mechanical keyboards
        </h3>
        <p>
            So I recently took the plunge into the ergonomic high end mechanical keyboard world and purchased myself an <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com">ErgoDox EZ</a>.
            Currently, I'm still in the "oh god what have I done" stage, where typing is slow and clunky and please don't ask me where <b>any</b> of the symbols are.
            I'll make my layout public at some point but I would never expect anyone to use it really, as it's a very personal thing, at least for me
        </p>
        <p>
            As for mechanical keyboards as a broader topic, they do greatly interest me as I feel like I'm barely scratching the surface currently.
            I really wish there was a better way to test out different switches than just having to commit to a keyboard full of ones I've never used.
            Now I have a keyboard with Cherry MX Browns, and while I love how quiet they are compared to my old <a href="https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/peripheral/keyboards/quick-fire-tk">Quickfire TK</a> with Cherry MX Blues, I wouldn't have chosen them based on the feel if I'd been able to try before I bought
        </p>
        <p>
            I totally want to get a set of custom keycaps at some point though, either a super large simple legend or a set of dot keycaps (like the <a href="https://candykeys.com/group-buys/gmk-dots">GMK Dots</a>).
            I do need that RGB support though so that makes things a tad trickier, but I do unironically find the backlighting useful when it's dark, I'm not just in it for the rainbow barf

            Headphones
        </h3>
        <p>
            As with mechanical keyboards, another hobby which I wish I had more time and money for is headphones (earphones too).
            I currently just listen to music off of my phone or computer directly, no fancy DACs or amps.
            Prodominantly, I listen to EDM, enjoying house, bounce, trap, and dance
        </p>
        <p>
            I use SoundCloud for all <a href="https://soundcloud.com/atkkta/sets">my playlists</a>, given it's free, and can be adblocked on browser and mobile.
            I typically grow a playlist until it's at 100 songs then start a new one, it's a nice round number that strikes a decent balance between not getting bored of the first songs you've added and having a long total running time.
            There is no particular organisation to most of my playlists in terms of genre
        </p>
        <p>
            For headphones, I currently have the entry level <a href="https://www.audio-technica.com/en-gb/ath-m50x">Audio-Technica ATH-M50x</a> with <a href="https://www.brainwavzaudio.com/products/headphone-pad-hybrid">Brainwavz memory foam pads</a>.
            Love them, wonderful, do really enjoy.
            I can wear them for hours without issue
        </p>
        <p>
            For earphones, I actually carry around the super-budget VE Monk Plus (<a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32417311324.html">AliExpress link</a>).
            Despite the $5 price tag, I love the sound quality (how you know I'm not an audiophile yet lol), they're impressively bassy for earphones, and they're comfortable for me - I actually have yet to find IEMs I find comfortable.
            I did actually splurge at one point to try the <a href="http://ibasso.com/cp_xq_dy.php?id=6025">iBasso IT01</a>, but I just couldn't get them both comfortable and properly sealed
        </p>
        <p>
            I currently have my eyes on the <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-wireless-headphones">Drop + THX Panda</a>.
            Better sound quality, sleek minimal no-brand aesthetic, and wireless connectivity üòç
            Trying to get my current side job finished so I can place my order!
