            Who is this Atk fella?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I'm a 20 year old computer science student.
            I enjoy any and all things computery - building computers, writing code, playing PC games, the whole shebang
        </p>
        <p>
            My most recent interest in the computing world has been Linux.
            I moved my personal laptop over to Arch Linux in late 2019 and have thoroughly enjoying working out everything as I go, building myself a competent customised workflow from the ground up.
            The FOSS community is awesome and I'm trying to find the time to give back to the community amoungst studying
        </p>
        <p>
            Privacy is also a huge part about the way I conduct myself online.
            Facebook, Google, Amazon, and the like possess a very real threat to everyone's privacy, seemingly without anyone caring.
            As such, I have been trying to migrate away from these data giants, ditching Gmail, Facebook, Twitch, and so on as I go, while also bolstering my personal security with a password manager and two factor authentication

            My monospace font of choice is <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono">Jetbrains Mono</a> for its readability and ligature support. (I am a <b>huge</b> ligature fan!)

            For serious coding, I love using the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com">Jetbrains IDEs</a>.
            I've mostly used IntelliJ and PyCharm, but I'd recommend the suite to anyone.
            Within the Jetbrains IDEs, I consider the <a href="https://www.material-theme.com">Material Theme plugin</a> essential to bring the UI into 2020.
            I use Material Darker of the themes it provides
        </p>
        <p>
            For casual projects (scripting languages or ones otherwise unsupported by Jetbrains), <a href="https://vscodium.com">VSCodium</a> is my go-to, it's Visual Studio Code but actually compiled to be FOSS, which <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/license">Visual Studio Code isn't</a> unless you build it yourself

            <a href="https://simplelogin.io">SimpleLogin</a> is a free and open source email obfuscator that hides your true email address from companies, similar to how <a href="https://privacy.com">Privacy.com</a> hides your card details from merchants.
            It allows you to setup aliases (like the one I have for the contact email address above) which will forward on the email to your real inbox so you have everything in one place but to merchants and other third parties everything is compartmentalised.
            This will tell you who's leaked your email address if it gets out, you can with a click disable an alias to send all of the emails sent there to the void

        <p>
            The real kicker to all this is there is a full guide on <a href="https://github.com/simple-login/app">SimpleLogin's GitHub page</a> to self-host everything yourself so you can use your own domain and access all the premium features for free.

        <h3>
            Mechanical keyboards
        </h3>
        <p>
            Currently I am using a keyboard that I built myself in June 2021! It's an <a href="https://www.idobao.net/products/idobao-id80v2-75-hot-swappable-mechanical-keyboard-kit">Idobao ID80v2</a> with Gateron yellow keyswitches (lubed with Krytox 205g0) and <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002120809746.html">these keycaps</a>.
            I love the sound and feel of this keyboard so much more than the Cherry MX browns I had on the Ergodox, and having all the symbols back is an absolute blessing.
            I've been using <a href="https://caniusevia.com/">VIA</a> to configure the keyboard, and while it's simple and pretty looking, I do think it lacks somewhat in ease of use and being feature complete to everything QMK offers.
            For instance, I really wish I could change my RGB underglow colour depending on the layer, and while I'm 95% sure QMK would support that, Via doesn't yet expose it.
            I would also like to see a FOSS competitor of course
        </p>
        <p>
            In late summer 2020, I took the plunge into the ergonomic high end mechanical keyboard world and purchased myself an <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com">ErgoDox EZ</a>.
            It was a trial by fire of learning how to use a split layout, ortholinear keyboard in conjunction with getting used to layers to access symbols and keys that otherwise just generally didn't fit on the layout.
            I did get used to typing on it in type, but I never really got comfortable with coding on it.
            I absolutely fell in love with how QMK firmware works with all of its special keys and layers and I daresay I shall be forever hooked on QMK.
            However I have now sold it on as I vastly prefer my new keyboard
        </p>
        <p>
            While at the time of writing I don't have any short-term plans to upgrade or build another keyboard, I definitely think I might explore a 65 or 60% keyboard next time, perhaps going ortholinear again.
            A split spacebar or dedicated layer keys would be really good as with the ID80 there is no dedicated key to use to navigate layers.
            No idea what I'd do for switches honestly, I'm so happy with my Gateron yellows currently, having come from Cherry blues and browns these are awesome ü§©

        <h3>
            Headphones
        </h3>
        <p>
            I currently just listen to music off of my phone or computer directly, no fancy DACs or amps.
            Prodominantly, I listen to EDM, enjoying house, bounce, trap, and dance
        </p>
        <p>
            I used to use SoundCloud for all <a href="https://soundcloud.com/atkkta/sets">my playlists</a>, given it's free, and can be adblocked on browser and mobile.
            I'm now actually using Tidal because there was a promotion for a 6 month free trial, but given the current controversy with their use of MQA and some of the bugs I've experienced with the app, I'm not sure I'll ever end up paying for it, as much as I've managed to build out several playlists by this point.
            I typically grow a playlist until it's at 100 songs then start a new one, it's a nice round number that strikes a decent balance between not getting bored of the first songs you've added and having a long total running time.
            There is no particular organisation to most of my playlists in terms of genre
        </p>
        <p>
            For earphones, I actually carry around the super-budget VE Monk Plus (<a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32417311324.html">AliExpress link</a>).
            Despite the $5 price tag, I love the sound quality (how you know I'm not an audiophile yet lol), they're impressively bassy for earphones, and they're comfortable for me - I actually have yet to find IEMs I find comfortable.
            I did actually splurge at one point to try the <a href="http://ibasso.com/cp_xq_dy.php?id=6025">iBasso IT01</a>, but I just couldn't get them both comfortable and properly sealed
        </p>
        <p>
            For headphones, I currently have the entry level <a href="https://www.audio-technica.com/en-gb/ath-m50x">Audio-Technica ATH-M50x</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR0xiIYvOSw">Grado SR60es</a>, and the <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-wireless-headphones">Drop + THX Pandas</a>

            These are the headphones I have wired up to my computer with a <a href="https://antlionaudio.com/products/modmic-uni">Modmic Uni</a> stuck on.
            Since I also have a speaker hooked up to the PC, this means these headphones are now exclusively used for playing games with voice comms.
            I have used them for music listening previously before I got my hands on the Grados and Pandas, however now they're just the super comfy go-to for several hour long gaming sessions.
            The comfort I think is in no small part thanks to the <a href="https://www.brainwavzaudio.com/products/headphone-pad-hybrid">Brainwavz memory foam pads</a> I purchased based on a recommendation I saw online for these headphones, they fit wonderfully and feel great against the head, less sweaty than my Pandas
        </p>

        <h4>
            Grado SR60e
        </h4>
        <p>
            The Grados were moreorless an impulse purchase under the influence of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7Jwj9fkrf1adN4fMmTkpug">DankPods</a> when I noticed they were largely out of stock online but there was a pair on eBay in great condition for a steal of a price.
            They have a very different sound to what I typically prefer and aren't that well suited to my genre of choice, but certain songs (like Avicii's Hey Brother) absolutely made the headphones sing (no better way to describe it) and justified the purchase in an instant.
            I'd strongly recommend these to anyone wanting to try open backs for the first time that listens to a lot of music with vocals.
            I also enjoy using them for watching movies when I'm alone as they do far better justice to the movie score than my speaker ever could
        </p>
        <p>
            Strongly considering modding the cable to be one-sided and detachable though as while I like and am always amused by how bulky and thick the cable is, it's inconvenient to the point where, when moving around with the headphones on, the swinging of the wire while walking can actually move where the headphones sit on my head.
            Definitely a sit down a listen type of headphone
        </p>

        <h4>
            Drop + THX Panda
        </h4>
        <p>
            I want to start of by saying I would not recommend these headphones for purchase.
            I have had extensive issues (as have numerous other people) with these headphones, and the replacement pair I received, while largely functional, had cosmetic damage out of the box.
            For those who play video games, these headphones feel akin to a full price game that's half-baked released into Early Access.
            For more details, you can read my review of the headphones on Drop's website <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-wireless-headphones/reviews/2799650">here</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            However, putting the issues I've head with them aside, the headphones sound and look great.
            The battery life is impressive, I've never had to stop listening to charge them, and on the rare occasion when it is time to top them up, they charge super quickly.
            The sound is lovely and full and compared to the Grados certainly brings back a lot of the bass and such that I enjoy with my tastes in EDM.
            Honestly the headphones being wireless was the biggest selling point for me.
            It allows for music listening in so many scenarios, without having to be considerate of a wire to be tugged if you turn your head too far.
            I enjoy wearing the headphones for things like cooking and washing up where a wire would be cumbersome but I appreciate the company of having music playing.
            Given the current COVID situation I've not worn them out of the house a lot to have missed active noise cancelling, but I certainly don't feel like I'm not getting value out of them being wireless as a result of being at home even more than I am usually
